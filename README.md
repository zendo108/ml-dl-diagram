# Machine Learning Teaching & Application Tool

This web app is designed to serve as both a **teaching aid** and a **real-world application tool** for machine learning (ML) concepts. It provides interactive visualizations, calculators, and guides to help users understand ML models and their applications.

## **Features**

### **1. Home Page**
- Introduction to the app and its purpose.
- Navigation menu linking to all sections.
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle** for better accessibility.

### **2. Interactive Guide**
- A dynamic, decision-making guide powered by **Mermaid.js**.
- Helps users select the most suitable ML model based on:
  - Task type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).
  - Data characteristics (size, complexity, and more).
  - Computational resources and other considerations.
- Includes links to individual model pages with detailed descriptions and real-world examples.

### **3. Accuracy & Metrics Calculator**
- A tool to calculate evaluation metrics for classification models:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1 Score**
- Features:
  - Input fields for confusion matrix values (TP, FP, TN, FN).
  - Real-time results displayed dynamically.
  - Intuitive interface for ease of use.

### **4. Convolution & Pooling Visualizer**
- Interactive tool to simulate and visualize:
  - **Convolution operations** with user-defined kernel sizes.
  - **Max pooling** and **average pooling** operations.
- Features:
  - User-defined grid sizes.
  - Dynamic generation of input and output grids.
  - Step-by-step visualization of the convolution and pooling process.

### **5. About/Help Page**
- Overview of the appâ€™s purpose and structure.
- Guidance on using each section.
- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) or a contact section for feedback.
