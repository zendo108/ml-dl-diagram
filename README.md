# Machine Learning Models Diagram

This project hosts an interactive visual guide for understanding and choosing the right machine learning models for various tasks. The guide is structured to help users navigate through models based on their characteristics, applications, and decision criteria.

## **Features**

- Interactive diagram explaining different machine learning models.
- Categories include **Prediction**, **Description**, and **Analysis/Comparison**.
- Covers supervised, unsupervised, and generative models like:
  - Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, K-Means, DBSCAN, Transformers, LLMs, and more.
- Mermaid-based decision algorithms for model selection.
- Example applications and suggestions for when models are not suitable.

## **How to Use**

1. Open the hosted **HTML file** in your browser.
2. Navigate the interactive diagram by clicking on categories and model-specific nodes.
3. Use the decision-making algorithms to determine which model is suitable for your dataset and task.
4. Explore example use cases and model features for better understanding.

## **Technical Requirements**

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Internet access (if hosting externally).
- Diagrams are generated using **Mermaid.js** for seamless integration.

## **Project Structure**

- **index.html**: The main interactive diagram file.
- **styles.css**: Custom styles for enhancing the diagram layout (if applicable).
- **README.md**: This guide.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Add real-world datasets for testing models.
- Integrate explanations for hyperparameter tuning.
- Provide links to pre-trained models for direct use.

## **Contributions**

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request for improvements or additional models.

## **Credits**

- Diagram generated using **Draw.io**.
- Mermaid.js used for creating interactive decision-making algorithms.
- Content authored with examples and guidelines for practical use.
